                Merced Senior Citizens, Inc. is a non-profit 501(c)(3) corporation established May 15,
                1984 “to provide on a non-profit basis, meeting facilities and services specially
                designed to meet the physical, social and psychological needs and to promote the
                health, security, happiness, usefulness and longer life of the senior community.”
                Many years ago Merced Senior Citizens Inc., a non-profit charitable corporation, joined
                forces with Merced City Parks and Recreation Department and the Redevelopment
                Agency to locate a site and design a Senior Community Center for the people of
                Merced, California. It took over 10 years to raise funds from grants, fees, donations,
                rummage sales, pancake breakfasts, BBQ’s, dinners, ice cream socials and many
                other events and activities. Once all the funds were raised a ground breaking was held
                in 1993 for the construction of Phase 1 of a building. The Center opened for business
                on September 15 th , 1994 with 9,500 square feet and a total cost of approximately 2.1
                million dollars. The non-profit group didn’t stop there! It was soon determined that
                additional space was needed and the Phase II addition was underway. The
                construction of Phase II added three rooms, an open area library and computer space
                to be enjoyed by Center visitors. The addition was completed and open for use July
                19th, 2001.

                Following the successful building fund drives, construction and opening of the Center it
                was decide that the purpose of Merced Senior Citizens, Inc. could be modified so it
                would still function as a 501(c)(3) corporation and be given the task of organizing the
                senior activity schedule for the Center and acting as a representative to the City for the
                senior users.

                Initially, Center operations went well; then The Great Recession of 2007-2009 hit the
                City of Merced. The City began to experience annual budget shortfalls and the
                Redevelopment Agency was closed. As City funds became short, reductions were
                inevitable. City employees at the Center front desk were replaced with Merced Senior
                Citizen Inc. volunteers. Building maintenance, both inside and out, has suffered over
                the recent years. Finally, the Covid19 Pandemic of 2020 shuttered the Center for 15
                months to local seniors. However, all was not lost. Since July 2021 the Center has
                been managed and staffed by Merced Senior Citizens Inc.’s Board of 11 volunteer
                Directors and 2 honorary appointees along with many more volunteers organizing
                groups and activities for the local seniors enjoyment.
